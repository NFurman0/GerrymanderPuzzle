# GerrymanderPuzzle
A website that generates and lets you solve Gerrymandering Puzzles, inspired by Deckard's video on these puzzles: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQQrFOgRjDg

Upcoming Features: 
    Functionality to create and share puzzles!
    More than two parties!
    Fully customizeable board sizes!
(These may never actually get added, but maybe I'll get around to them eventually)
